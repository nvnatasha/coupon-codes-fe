### Abstract:
I would like to start this out by saying I appreciate how for every project sing Hang In There, the readme's have it or the title. 
In the frontend of this application, functionality was created to properly render the different 'views' for merchants, items, merchant's items, and merchant's coupons. 
Additional functionality lets a user create a new merchant, and/or create a new item for a merchant.
'Pages' created for rendering merchants and items to make for a more aesthetically pleasing experience. 

### Installation Instructions:
1. Clone forked repo and rename it `git clone <repo> <new name>`
1. `cd` into cloned repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run dev` to start developing.
  1. You'll see in the terminal that the project has opened at "http://localhost:5173/"
Along with connecting into the server of the backend so there is data to be rendered. 

### Preview of App:
I would prefer this to be a surprise. 

### Context:
For the frontend of this project, I worked on it for maybe 6 hours total in a day, since I played around with adding functionality and such. 

### Learning Goals:
The learning goals are to be able to build off and complete a project that has already been worked on, but is a little incomplete. 

### Wins + Challenges:
The win is always getting it done, and hopefully doing so in a proficient manner.
My biggest challenge this time was time, due to a lack of childcare during this project.
